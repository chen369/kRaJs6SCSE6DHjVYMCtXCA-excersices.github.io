# Eye Movement Exercise
Hey there! 
In JavaScript, you know that events are a big part of it, especially when it comes to web development. I'll be building a page where you can have Eyes follow your mouse pointer using Javascript Events as part of a MIT xPRO Excersise.

# How to run
Navigate to `https://chen369.github.io/kRaJs6SCSE6DHjVYMCtXCA-excersices.github.io`
Hover mouse above eyes. 
Enjoy!
